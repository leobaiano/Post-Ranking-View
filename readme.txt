= Showing the ranking of posts =

To display a list of posts you have two options:

`<?php
if ( function_exists( 'displayRanking' ) ) {
displayRanking();
}
?>`

2 - Save an array with the data in a variable
`<?php
if (function_exists ('displayRanking')) {
$posts = displayRanking( '','','', true );
?>`

= Parameters of the function = 

<?php
	displayRanking( $amount, $post_type, $category, $print );

	$amount - Amount of posts to be displayed. Default = 5
	$post_type - Type of post that should be considered in the ranking, if not set all kind of posts will enter the ranking. Default = null
	$category - Category that should be considered in the ranking, if not set posts from all categories will enter the ranking. Default = null
	$print - Sets whether HTML is returned or an array with the posts ranking. Default = null ( display HTML )
?>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the look of the list of posts? =

The plugin does not bring any CSS style for the list of posts, the visual follows the style sheet theme, so to change the look just customize the CSS of the theme.

= How do I change the amount of posts being displayed in the rankings? = 

The first parameter of the function to set the number of posts by default 5 posts will be listed, but if you want to change this value just set the value in the first parameter. For example, if you want the 10 most viewed posts are displayed use the following code to call the ranking:

`<?php
if ( function_exists( 'displayRanking' ) ) {
displayRanking(10);
}
?>`
